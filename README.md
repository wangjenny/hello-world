Creating my first git repo

Today is also National Pancakes Day. I really wish I could go to IHOP and get a free short stack of pancakes. 
They are also raising money today so the money I would have spent on pancakes can go towards the charity instead.
I'll have to hurry though as the deal ends at 7pm tonight.
